            <p>The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor within New York City. The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel.</p>
            <p>The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886, and it became an icon of freedom and democracy. It welcomed millions of immigrants who arrived in America by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The statue is identified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the United States.</p>
            <p>Standing at 305 feet (93 meters) including its pedestal, the statue represents Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom. She holds a torch above her head and carries a tabula ansata (a rectangular tablet evoking the law) upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776.</p>
