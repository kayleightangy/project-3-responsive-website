            <p>The Wonder Wheel is the iconic ferris wheel at Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park in Coney Island, Brooklyn. Standing 150 feet tall, it has been a centerpiece of the boardwalk skyline since its debut in 1920.</p>
            <p>Coney Island has been a hub of seaside amusement for more than a century, known for its thrilling rides, bright lights, and summertime energy. From the historic Cyclone roller coaster to modern attractions, it remains one of New York City's most beloved destinations for fun by the beach.</p>
            <p>The Wonder Wheel was designated a New York City landmark in 1989. It's not just a ride but an engineering marvel, featuring both stationary cars and "swinging" cars that tilt outward as the wheel turns, providing riders with different experiences and breathtaking views of the Atlantic Ocean and New York Harbor.</p>
