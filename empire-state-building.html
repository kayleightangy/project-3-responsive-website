            <p>The Empire State Building is a 102-story Art Deco skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was designed by architects Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and completed in 1931. The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (381 m) and stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.2 m) tall, including its antenna.</p>
            <p>For nearly 40 years after its completion, the Empire State Building was the world's tallest building until the original World Trade Center was built in the 1970s. It was named after the nickname for New York State, "the Empire State," and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986.</p>
            <p>The building offers spectacular views of New York City from its 86th and 102nd floor observatories. Its distinctive silhouette has been featured in countless films, including "King Kong" (1933) and "Sleepless in Seattle" (1993), making it one of the most famous buildings in the world.</p>
