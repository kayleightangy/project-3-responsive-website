            <p>The Roosevelt Island Tramway is a aerial tramway that connects Roosevelt Island to the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City. Opened in 1976, the tramway was originally intended as a temporary solution for accessing Roosevelt Island during the construction of a subway station.</p>
            <p>The tramway spans 3,100 feet (940 meters) across the East River and offers stunning views of Manhattan, Queens, and the United Nations Headquarters. Each cable car can carry up to 110 passengers and the journey takes approximately 10 minutes one way.</p>
            <p>Roosevelt Island itself is a narrow island in the East River with a rich history, including serving as a quarantine hospital in the 18th century and housing facilities for various social institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, it's a residential community with parks, historic sites, and modern apartment complexes.</p>
