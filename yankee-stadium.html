            <p>Yankee Stadium is a baseball park located in the Concourse neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City. It serves as the home ballpark for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball and New York City FC of Major League Soccer.</p>
            <p>The current stadium opened in 2009, replacing the original Yankee Stadium that operated from 1923 to 2008. The original stadium was called "The House That Ruth Built" in honor of Babe Ruth, whose legendary home runs helped finance the construction. The new stadium was designed to replicate the exterior facade of the original while incorporating modern amenities and technology.</p>
            <p>Beyond baseball, Yankee Stadium hosts concerts, soccer matches, and other major events. It's recognized as one of the premier sports venues in the world and continues the Yankees' legacy of excellence, having hosted 26 World Series championships, more than any other Major League Baseball franchise.</p>
